# DataVisualization_CourseWork
We had been given six datasets of an infamous company named ChrisCo. The company manages a variety of venues all across the United Kingdom. Compiling the given datasets into two dataframes, one is of the daily visitorsâ€™ data and the second one would be the summary data where all the datasets (Age, Distance, Duration, Gender, Spend) are compiled into one dataframe. After compiling the datasets into dataframe, we need to perform various data visualisations for conclusion and characteristics: such as correlations, seasonal behaviour, outliers, and so on.
